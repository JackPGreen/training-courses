# Hazelcast Training

This is the new home for lab exercises that are used in Hazelcast training courses (whether delivered
on-line or on-site)

If you're not attending one of these sessions it's not going to be a great learning
resource. Instead you should go [here](https://training.hazelcast.com/) and sign-up
for the *free* online training.

For instructions, see the README.md file under each course heading.
